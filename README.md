# node-modules-analyzer

We all know how node_modules has this bad reputation of being heavier than the size of earth, or even the sun!

Node package system is a weird ecosystem, it has not so good documentation and there are multiple ways of doing things that we never know which one is the correct! I’m an example of someone that was completely overwhelmed by the documentation and when i published my package I didn’t know the correct way to do that! Many people don’t know either and we end up having things like this

Many developers don't know how to properly publish their packages, given missing information around the internet, all guides mislead developers to do the wrong thing! 

`node-modules-analyzer` is a set of tools that help you with that! We bring tools that analyze, report, prune and warn you about what are the problems that are happening on your package, what is going wrong on your app `node_modules`, tools to prune and make your folder leaner!

Let's rock it and make the ecosystem better!
